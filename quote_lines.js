  "At times of writing I never think what I have said before. My aim is not to be consistent with my previous statements on a given question, but to be consistent with truth as it may present itself to me at a given moment. The result has been that I have grown from truth to truth.",
  "Doing nothing is better than being busy doing nothing.",
  "He who binds to himself a Joy,",
  "Does the winged life destroy;",
  "He who kisses the Joy as it flies,",
  "Lives in Eternitys sunrise.",
  "The door you open to give love is the very one through which love arrives.",
  "Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.",
  "Generosity is another quality which, like patience, letting go, non-judging, and trust, provides a solid foundation for mindfulness practice.",
  "Wise and strong is he who leaves his heart open and searches without fear.",
  "There are only four great questions in life: What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for? What is worth dying for? The answer to all of them is the same: Only Love.",
  "Those of us who have transcended mythical belief systems know without any doubt that there is no God up in the sky. But when we awaken to what I call the evolutionary impulse - the mysterious passion to evolve, to become, to develop on every level--we rediscover who God is.",
  "We dont see things as they are. We see things as we are.",
  "Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.",
  "Only in quiet waters things mirror themselves undistorted. Only in a quiet mind is adequate perception of the world.",
  "Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here. The spiritual journey is the relinquishment, or unlearning, of fear and the acceptance of love back into our hearts.",
  "So many assume the truth is either black or white... Its all evolution or its totally creation, for example. Reality creates consciousness; consciousness creates reality. Actually truth is inclusive, neither black nor white, nor a shade of grey. Indeed, truth is a multicolored spectrum, a beautiful hologram!",
  "The truth in you remains as radiant as a star, as pure as light, as innocent as love itself.",
  "Choose again.",
  "Pretend that you are enlightened.",
  "Pretend that you are loved by God.",
  "Pretend that you are perfect just the way you are.",
  "Take a deep breath now and PRETEND WHAT IS TRUE.",
  "Then everything will make sense.",
  "When you pretend something that is true, then you immediately become that Truth.",
  "First the energy of God descends upon the Earth, then it pretends whatever it wants to be, then it ascends back to its source. You are God pretending to be whatever you are right now. Do you understand what this means? You have allowed yourself to descend, but by pretending to be less than what you are, you have not ascended back to God.",
  "Love is much more fundamental than any kind of thinking or believing. It is the root and basis of who you are, at the most fundamental level. This means that anything other than love as an expression of your being is artificial and unnatural and is a result of not knowing who you are.",
  "Too Slow for those who Wait,",
  "Too Swift for those who Fear,",
  "Too Long for those who Grieve,",
  "Too Short for those who Rejoice,",
  "But for those who Love",
  "Time is not.",
  "We are more than what we do... much more than what we accomplish... far more than what we possess.",
  "Your thoughts are like the seeds you plant in your garden. Your beliefs are like the soil in which you plant these seeds.",
  "In the province of the mind, what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true.",
  "Dont believe everything you think.",
  "Some things have to be believed to be seen.",
  "Dont think you are, know you are!",
  "Perhaps the only limits to the human mind are those we believe in.",
  "We do not see things as they are. We see them as we are.",
  "If the only prayer you said in your whole life was, thank you, that would suffice.",
  "There are two ways to slide easily through life: to believe everything or to doubt everything; both ways save us from thinking.",
  "What is needed is not the will to believe but the will to find out, which is the exact opposite.",
  "The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen, nor touched... but are felt in the heart.",
  "Asking the proper questions is the central action of transformation. Questions are the key that causes the secret doors of the psyche to swing open.",
  "Theres no beauty that you could perceive or create if it were not already within you...",
  "What we see depends mainly on what we look for.",
  "Why is it that if someone tells you that there are 1 billion stars in the universe you will believe them but if they tell you a wall has wet paint you will have to touch it to be sure?",
  "Evil (ignorance) is like a shadow—it has no real substance of its own, it is simply a lack of light. You cannot cause a shadow to disappear by trying to fight it, stamp on it, by railing against it, or any other form of emotional or physical resistance. In order to cause a shadow to disappear, you must shine light on it.",

  "What we think is less than what we know;",
  "What we know is less than what we love;",
  "What we love is so much less than what there is.",
  "And to that precise extent we are so much less than what we are.",
  "When we love, we are the universe and the universe lives in us.",
  "The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding.",
  "You live in illusions and the appearance of things. There is a Reality, you are that Reality. When you recognize this you will realize you are nothing, and being nothing, you are everything. That is all.",
  "If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.",
  "Man has no body distinct from his soul; for that called body is a portion of soul discerned by the five senses, the chief inlets of soul in this age.",
  "I sought my God and my God I could not find. I sought my soul and my soul eluded me. I sought my brother to serve him in his need, and I found all three—my God, my soul, and thee.",
  "Gratitude is the hearts memory.",
  "My religion is simple, my religion is kindness.",
  "Faith is like a toothbrush. Every person should have one and use it regularly, but he shouldnt try to use someone elses.",
  "The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult and left untried.",
  "Do not dwell in the past, do not dwell in the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.",
  "What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.",
  "This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness.",
  "We must never cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time.",
  "To be identified with your mind is to be trapped in time: the compulsion to live almost exclusively through memory and anticipation. This creates an endless preoccupation with past and future and an unwillingness to honor and acknowledge the present moment and allow it to be. The compulsion arises because the past gives you an identity and the future holds the promise of salvation, of fulfillment in whatever form. Both are illusions.",
  "Love is a force more formidable than any other. It is invisible, it cannot be seen or measured, yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment, and offer you more joy than any material possession could.",
  "My religion is simple, my religion is kindness.",
  "As human beings we all want to be happy and free from misery… we have learned that the key to happiness is inner peace. The greatest obstacles to inner peace are disturbing emotions such as anger, attachment, fear and suspicion, while love and compassion and a sense of universal responsibility are the sources of peace and happiness.",
  "God will become visible as Gods image is reborn in you.",
  "The Spirit is neither good nor bad, it runs where the wild heart leads",
  "Wisdom begins in wonder.",
  "To speak gratitude is courteous and pleasant, to enact gratitude is generous and noble, but to live gratitude is to touch Heaven.",
  "We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy is when men are afraid of the light.",
  "The best way to know God is to love many things.",
  "Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands, but like the seafaring man on the desert of waters, you choose them as your guides, and following them, you reach your destiny.",
  "Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity.",
  "The highest form of spiritual work is the realization of the essence of man.... You never learn the answer; you can only become the answer.",
  "Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things.",
  "Be ready when opportunity comes.... Luck is when preparation and opportunity meet.",
  "Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can.",
  "One important key to success is self-confidence. An important key to self-confidence is preparation.",
  "For myself I am an optimist - it does not seem to be much use being anything else.",
  "What a wonderful life Ive had! I only wish Id realized it sooner.",
  "Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance.",
  "What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.",
  "Let us rise up and be thankful, for Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.",
  "Both abundance and lack exist simultaneously in our lives, as parallel realities. It is always our conscious choice which secret garden we will tend... when we choose to be grateful for the abundance thats present -- love, health, family, friends, work, the joys of nature and personal pursuits that bring us pleasure -- the wasteland of lack falls away and we experience heaven on Earth.",
  "The height of your accomplishments is determined by the depth of your convictions.",
  "There are three kinds of people: those who let it happen, those who make it happen, and those who wonder what happened.",
  "It is not in everyones power to secure wealth, office, or honors; but everyone may be good, generous, and wise.",
  "If youre never scared or embarrassed or hurt, it means you never take any chances.",
  "Being defeated is often only a temporary condition. Giving up is what makes it permanent.",
  "Some people say I have attitude - maybe I do. But I think you have to. You have to believe in yourself when no one else does - that makes you a winner right there.",
  "The tragedy of life doesnt lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach.",
  "Education is the great engine of personal development. It is through education that the daughter of a peasant can become a doctor, that the son of a mineworker can become the head of the mine, that a child of farm workers can become the president of a great nation. It is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another.",
  "View money and things not as something you create to fill a lack, but as tools to help you more fully express yourself and realize your potential.",
  "Abilities wither under faultfinding, blossom with encouragement.",
  "We have to do the best we can. This is our sacred human responsibility.",
  "When we feel stuck, going nowhere - even starting to slip backward - we may actually be backing up to get a running start.",
  "What is opportunity, and when does it knock? It never knocks. You can wait a whole lifetime, listening, hoping, and you will hear no knocking. None at all. You are opportunity, and you must knock on the door leading to your destiny.",
  "Learn to expect, not to doubt. In so doing, you bring everything into the realm of possibility.",
  "Go out looking for one thing, and thats all youll ever find.",

  "The journey of a thousand miles must begin with a small step.",
  "A wise man should have money in his head, but not in his heart.",
  "Integrity is the essence of everything successful.",
  "Money - like health, love, happiness, and all forms of success that you want to create for yourself - is the result of living purposefully. It is not a goal unto itself.",
  "The gratification of wealth is not found in mere possession or in lavish expenditure, but in its wise application.",
  "The real measure of your wealth is how much youd be worth if you lost all your money.",
  "Entrepreneurship is a state of mind, a can-do attitude, a capacity to focus on a vision and work toward it.",
  "I believe life is a series of near misses. A lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all. Its seizing the day and accepting responsibility for your future. Its seeing what other people dont see and pursuing that vision.",
  "Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power.",
  "Winners are losers who got up and gave it one more try.",
  "Either you deal with what is the reality or you can be sure that the reality is going to deal with you.",
  "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.",
  "The greater danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it.",
  "Life is not measured by its length, but by its depth.",
  "The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they cant find them, they make them.",
  "There is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning desire to possess it.",
  "I cant change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.",
  "Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.",
  "A pessimist is one who makes difficulties of opportunities. An optimist makes opportunities of so-called difficulties.",
  "Ships are safe within the harbor, but is that what ships are for?",
  "Action is a great restorer and builder of confidence. Inaction is not only the result, but the cause, of fear. Perhaps the action you take will be successful; perhaps different action or adjustments will have to follow. But any action is better than no action at all.",
  "Winners are the people who when the odds are stacked against them, and those around them have fallen, will have the courage to look within themselves and make the unbelieveable believeable, and the impossible possible.",
  "When you follow your bliss doors will open where you would not have thought there would be doors; and where there wouldnt be a door for anyone else.",
  "Let others lead small lives, but not you. Let others argue over small things, but not you. Let others cry over small hurts, but not you. Let others leave their future in someone elses hands, but not you.",
  "Persistent people begin their success where others end in failure.",
  "Create a set of great personal values and surround yourself with the right people that can form your support system. Have an optimistic spirit and develop a strong purpose that you completely believe in and everything you can imagine is possible, for you.",
  "If youre going through hell, keep going.",
  "Things that are impossible just take longer.",
  "The darkest hour has only sixty minutes.",
  "All I would tell people is to hold onto what was individual about themselves, not to allow their ambition for success to cause them to try to imitate the success of others. Youve got to find it on your own terms.",
  "Money like health, love, happiness, and all forms of success that you want to create for yourself is the result of living purposefully. It is not a goal unto itself.",
  "We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.",
  "Good instincts usually tell you what to do long before your head has figured it out.",
  "Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.",
  "It is good to dream, but it is better to dream and work. Faith is mighty, but action with faith is mightier. Desiring is helpful, but work and desire are invincible.",
  "When the bulls-eye becomes as big in your mind as an elephant, you are sure to hit it.",
  "Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.",
  "The minute you settle for less than you deserve, you get even less than you settled for.",
  "Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently.",
  "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.",
  "The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man perfected without trials.",
  "The two things I did learn were that you are as powerful and strong as you allow yourself to be, and that the most difficult part of any endeavor is taking the first step, making the first decision.",
  "Whether you be man or woman, you will never do anything in this world without courage. It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor.",
  "Optimism is essential to achievement and it is also the foundation of courage and true progress.",
  "If successful people have one common trait, its an utter lack of cynicism. The world owes them nothing. They go out and find what they need without asking for permission; theyre driven, talented, and work through negatives by focusing on the positives.",
  "It takes as much energy to wish as it does to plan.",
  "The wise man bridges the gap by laying out the path by means of which he can get from where he is to where he wants to go.",
  "To accomplish great things, we must not only act, but also dream; not only plan, but also believe.",
  "Trials, temptations, disappointments -- all these are helps instead of hindrances, if one uses them rightly. They not only test the fibre of a character, but strengthen it. Every conquered temptation represents a new fund of moral energy. Every trial endured and weathered in the right spirit makes a soul nobler and stronger than it was before.",
  "If you have made mistakes there is always another chance for you... you may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for this thing we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down.",
  "Apathy can be overcome by enthusiasm, and enthusiasm can be aroused by two things: first, an idea which takes the imagination by storm; and second, a definite, intelligible plan for carrying that idea into action.",
  "Energy is the essence of life. Every day you decide how youre going to use it by knowing what you want and what it takes to reach that goal, and by maintaining focus.",
  "You cant help someone get up a hill without getting closer to the top yourself.",
  "Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.",
  "Action is where its at, as far as making dreams come true. We ourselves are the prime channel for our creations, so if we dont act but just wait, then we are blocking the channel. If we do act then we will be supported by all that we are connected to... which is All That Is if we act with love and service as our motivation.",
  "You are your own most important resource for making your life work. Life rewards action. Until your knowledge, awareness, insights, and understandings are translated into action, they are of no value.",
  "Be thankful for what you have; youll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you dont have, you will never, ever have enough.",
  "You dont get in life what you want. You get what you are.",
  "Nothing is more endangered in the modern world than the powerful combination of hard work toward meaningful goals joined with an exuberant embrace of the present moment.",
  "It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.",
  "All problems become smaller if you dont dodge them, but confront them.",
  "Life is mostly froth and bubble. Two things stand like stone: kindness in anothers trouble, courage in our own.",
  "That which does not kill you makes you stronger.",
  "Its easy to be brave from a safe distance.",
  "Its not because things are difficult that we do not dare; its because we do not dare that they are difficult.",
  "Though no one can go back and make a brand new start,",
  "anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.",
  "The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty.",
  "Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterward.",
  "Experience is that marvelous thing that enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again.",
  "Only those who do nothing at all make no mistakes... but that would be a mistake.",
  "Life is a leap into the unknown. If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster.",
  "Be master of your petty annoyances and conserve your energies for the big,  worthwhile things. It isnt the mountain ahead that wears you out - its the grain  of sand in your shoe.",
  "Destiny is as destiny does. If you believe you have no control, then you have no control.",
  "Vision without action is a daydream; action without vision is a nightmare.",
  "Persistence. Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan, Press on, has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.",
  "Courage is the mastery of fear, not the absence of fear.",
  "Be like a postage stamp. Stick to one thing until you get there.",
  "I couldnt wait for success....so I went ahead without it.",
  "If you can find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesnt lead anywhere.",
  "If you really want to do something, youll find a way; if you dont, youll find an excuse.",
  "He who dares nothing need hope for nothing.",
  "Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs - even though checkered by failure - than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.",
  "A coward gets scared and quits. A hero gets scared, but still goes on.",
  "The Dilemma...",
  "To laugh is to risk appearing a fool.",
  "To weep is to risk appearing sentimental.",
  "To reach out for another is to risk involvement.",
  "To expose feelings is to risk rejection.",
  "To place your dreams before a crowd is to risk ridicule.",
  "To love is to risk not being loved in return.",
  "To go forward in the face of overwhelming odds is to risk failure.",
  "But risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing.",
  "The person who risks nothing does nothing, has nothing, is nothing.",
  "He may avoid suffering and sorrows, but he cannot learn, feel, change, grow, or love.",
  "Chained by his certitudes, he is a slave - he has forfeited his freedom.",
  "Only a person who takes risks is FREE",
  "Healing comes from taking responsibility: to realize that it is you - and no one else - that creates your thoughts, your feelings, and your actions.",
  "Life is a journey and if you fall in love with the journey you will be in love forever.",
  "When you return to your old hometown, you find it wasnt the town you missed, but your childhood.",
  "As we grow old, the beauty steals inward.",
  "Life begins as a quest of the child for the man, and ends as a journey by the man to rediscover the child.",
  "Ultimately your greatest teacher is to live with an open heart.",
  "Doing what you like is freedom. Liking what you do is happiness.",
  "We forge the chains we wear in life.",
  "If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never be fulfilled.  If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself.  Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are.  When you realize there is nothing lacking, the world belongs to you.",
  "Everything is a gift of the universe —even joy, anger, jealously, frustration, or separateness. Everything is perfect either for our growth or our enjoyment.",
  "There is no such thing as a problem without a gift for you in its hands. You seek problems because you need their gifts.",
  "If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes.",
  "Tension is who you think you should be, relaxation is who you are.",
  "I believe the recipe for happiness to be just enough money to pay the monthly bills you acquire, a little surplus to give you confidence, a little too much work each day, enthusiasm for your work, a substantial share of good health, a couple of real friends and a wife and children to share lifes beauty with you.",
  "For me it is sufficient to have a corner by my hearth, a book and a friend, and a nap undisturbed by creditors or grief.",
  "The art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than growing with them.",
  "Be happy with what you have. Be excited about what you want.",
  "Our capacity to draw happiness from aesthetic objects or material goods in fact seems critically dependent on our first satisfying a more important range of emotional or psychological needs, among them the need for understanding, for love, expression and respect.",
  "If you start to think the problem is out there, stop yourself. That thought is the problem.",
  "Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude.",
  "Happiness is not a station you arrive at, but a manner of traveling.",
  "Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.",
  "Security is when everything is settled, when nothing can happen to you; security is the denial of life.",
  "Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it.",
  "Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.",
  "The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. As long as this exists, and it certainly always will, then there will be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be.",
  "In our lives, change is unavoidable, loss is unavoidable. In the adaptability and ease with which we experience change, lies our happiness and freedom.",
  "Live with intention. Walk to the edge. Listen hard. Practice wellness. Play with abandon. Laugh. Choose with no regret. Do what you love. Live as if this is all there is.",
  "You never regret being kind.",
  "They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.",
  "Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future.",
  "The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly.",
  "True happiness is not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.",
  "Most of us miss out on lifes big prizes. The Pulitzer. The Nobel. Oscars. The World Cup. But were all eligible for lifes smaller prizes... A pat on the back. A kiss behind the ear. A four-pound bass. A full moon. An empty parking space. A crackling fire. A great meal. A glorious sunset. Hot soup. Cold beer.",
  "Money is neither my god nor my devil. It is a form of energy that tends to make us more of who we already are, whether its greedy or loving.",
  "The need for forgiveness is an illusion. There is nothing to forgive.",
  "Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting.",
  "Reflect upon you present blessings, of which every man has many - not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some.",
  "Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.",
  "Much of the stress that people feel doesnt come from having too much to do. It comes from not finishing what theyve started.",
  "He who lives in harmony with himself lives in harmony with the universe.",

  "We can have peace if we let go of wanting to change the past and wanting to control the future.",
  "We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give.",
  "Money doesnt bring happiness and creativity. Your creativity and happiness brings money.",
  "Happiness is the experience of loving life.  Being happy is being in love with that momentary experience. And love is looking at someone or even something and seeing the absolute best in him/her or it.  Love is happiness with what you see. So love and happiness really are the same thing... just expressed differently.",
  "Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.",
  "God comforts the disturbed and disturbs the comfortable.",
  "Carefully watch your THOUGHTS, for they become your WORDS. Manage and watch your WORDS, for they will become your ACTIONS. Consider and judge your ACTIONS, for they have become your HABITS.

  "Wisdom is knowing what path to take next... Integrity is taking it.",
  "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.",
  "I am not bound to win, I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live up to the light I have.",
  "Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.",
  "We all get report cards in many different ways, but the real excitement of what youre doing is in the doing of it. Its not what youre gonna get in the end - its not the final curtain - its really in the doing it, and loving what youre doing.",
  "Happiness in life is not measured by the things we achieve, the places we go, or the route that we take to get there. Happiness in life is measured by the people that we share all of our experiences with.",
  "There is no stress in the world, only people thinking stressful thoughts and then acting on them.",
  "In the midst of movement and chaos, keep stillness inside of you.",
  "Everything is a gift of the universe - even joy, anger, jealously, frustration, or separateness. Everything is perfect either for our growth or our enjoyment.",

  "The happiness of life is made up of the little charities of a kiss or smile, a kind look, a heartfelt compliment.",

  "If we become uncomfortable in any given moment, we can look at a flower, a pebble in the street or the tire on our car and be grateful. We can gaze at a person in the distance or at a cloud in the sky and be appreciative. We can smile at a stranger, hug someone we know or tidy a disorganized shelf and be thankful for the opportunity. If we choose gratitude, we will be happy!",
  "Life isnt measured by the breaths you take, but by the moments that take your breath away.",

  "Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.  Was it worth it?",
  "The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.",

It is always our conscious choice which secret garden we will tend...when we choose not to focus on what is missing from our lives but are grateful for the abundance thats present—love, health, family, friends, work, the joys of nature and personal pursuits that bring us pleasure—the wasteland of illusion falls away and we experience Heaven on earth.",

  "View life as a series of movie frames, the ending and meaning may not be apparent until the very end of the movie, and yet, each of the hundreds of individual frames has meaning within the context of the whole movie.",
  "  View your life from your funeral, looking back at your life experiences, what have you accomplished? what would you have wanted to accomplish but didnt? what were the happy moments? what were the sad? what would you do again, and what you wouldnt?",

  "Love can make a summer fly, or a night seem like a lifetime.",
  "Someones opinion of you does not have to become your reality.",
  "Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.",
  "What is most beautiful in virile men is something feminine; what is most beautiful in feminine women is something masculine.",
  "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.",
  "Have the courage to be sincere, clear and honest. This opens the door to deeper communication all around. It creates self-empowerment and the kind of connections with others we all want in life. Speaking from the heart frees us from the secrets that burden us. These secrets are what make us sick or fearful. Speaking truth helps you get clarity on your real heart directives.",
  "If we center ourselves within the heart chakra and control our thoughts, we can find the balance and harmony in every situation.",
  "Abilities wither under faultfinding, blossom with encouragement.",
  "Oh the comfort, the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person, having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but pouring them all right out, just as they are - chaff and grain together - certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep what is worth keeping, and with the breath of kindness blow the rest away.",

  "The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and richness to life that nothing else can bring.",
  "The wise stand out because they see themselves as part of the Whole. They shine because they dont want to impress. They achieve great things because they dont look for recognition. Their wisdom is contained in what they are, not their opinions. They refuse to argue, so no-one argues with them.",
  "The judgement of others does not change who I am. Quite the opposite is true. It reveals who they are.",

  "Talk sense to a fool and he calls you foolish.",
  "If you tell the truth, you dont have to remember anything.",
  "A friend is someone who knows the song of your soul and sings it back to you when youve forgotten the words.",

  "Dont rob a friend, a partner, family member or the world of someone that could have been a real companion, and someone that could make a difference. Dont ever give up being special!",
  "Thats what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is. Most people love you for who you pretend to be. To keep their love, you keep pretending - performing. You get to love your pretence. Its true, were locked in an image, an act - and the sad thing is, people get so used to their image, they grow attached to their masks. They love their chains. They forget all about who they really are. And if you try to remind them, they hate you for it, they feel like youre trying to steal their most precious possession.",

  "It is your decisions not your conditions that truly shape the quality of your life.",
  "Life is found in the dance between your deepest desire and your greatest fear.",
  "How do we keep our inner fire alive? Two things, at minimum, are needed: an ability to appreciate the positives in our life - and a commitment to action. Every day, its important to ask and answer these questions: Whats good in my life? and What needs to be done?",

Keep your values positive because your values become your destiny.",
  "A smooth sea never made a skilled mariner.",

Leadership does not need to be a dramatic, fist in the air and trumpets blaring, activity.",

If you assume that theres no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, that there are opportunities to change things, there is a chance you may contribute to making a better world. The choice is yours.",

  "A human being is a part of a whole, called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.",

I possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration, I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or de-humanized. If we treat people as they are, we make them worse.
